This is a small testing application developed to explore the basics of Angular. The idea of creating a travel forum stemmed from my love for travel. ✈️ I decided to build this project using Angular and TypeScript, both of which are new to me. Through this project, I aimed to identify similarities between Angular and React, but I found them to be very different frameworks.

You may have noticed that TS is weakly written. As i mentioned TS and Angular are unknown to me, my focus right now is on Angular`s basics and in the future i will correct the types when i have more solid understanding of how TS works.

Since it is challenging to find up-to-date information about Angular's updates, I welcome any advice or suggestions, especially from those with Angular experience. 📚 <br/>
