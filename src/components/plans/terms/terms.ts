  {
    explanation: `Each contract has a duration of 24 months, during which customers benefit from preferential pricing. 
 Upon the expiration of the contract term, the price will increase by 4 euros. If a customer wishes to terminate the contract prior to its expiration, a fee equivalent to three non-preferential monthly payments will be applied. 
 * For example, if your current plan costs 20.99 euros, an early termination will result in a fee of three payments at 24.99 euros each. 
 However, if the contract holder qualifies under our 'Impasse Policy,' the contract may be terminated at any time. The Impasse Policy covers circumstances such as the contract holder's death, a change in family status (e.g., divorce), or financial hardship, defined as a 30% reduction below the minimum wage, with official documentation required as proof.`,

    explanation: `All customers are eligible for device discounts with each signed plan. 
These discounts can be applied to any device, and customers have the option to purchase a device through a 24-month installment plan, 
where a fixed monthly amount will be added to the plan's tax. If the customer exceeds the device's discount the rest of the money is not being given. \n
*For example: \n
If a customer chooses a device with the price of 200 euros and the given discount for a device is 300 euros, the rest 100 euros are not given to the client!`,

  {
    explanation: `The contract termination policy for corporate customers mirrors that of regular customers. 
 If a corporate customer wishes to transfer a SIM card to a regular contract, this can only be done upon the expiration of the current corporate contract (after 24 months). 
 * Early termination will incur a fee equivalent to three non-preferential monthly payments.`,
